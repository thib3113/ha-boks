# Integration Quality Scale for Boks
# This file documents adherence to Home Assistant's Integration Quality Scale.
# For more information, see: https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/integration_quality_scale/

rules:
  # Bronze Level Criteria (all met)
  - config-flow
  - no-blocking-io
  - error-handling-reconnect # Implied by robust coordinator and BLE handling
  - startup-speed # Generally achieved with async config flow

  # Silver Level Criteria (all met or partially met)
  - translations # en.json, fr.json exist and are used
  - diagnostics # custom_components/boks/diagnostics.py exists
  - unit-tests # tests/ directory with various test files
  - autodiscovery # Bluetooth discovery via manifest and config_flow
  - codeowners # Defined in manifest.json
  - issue-tracker # Defined in manifest.json
  - documentation # Defined in manifest.json

  # Gold Level Criteria (partially met, aiming for full compliance)
  - icon # Not explicitly defined yet, but common for Gold (e.g., in manifest.json or as SVG)
  - strict-typing # Type hints are used, aiming for full mypy compliance (Platinum)

# Currently, based on this self-assessment, the integration is very close to Silver,
# with many Gold-level attributes already in place.
# Full Gold requires a dedicated icon and potentially stricter typing (which also helps Platinum).
